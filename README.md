## 🧾 POS System – Backend Documentation (Spring Boot)

- Auth Service
    
    
    1. ✅ **Create a new Spring Boot project** from scratch.
    2. ⚙️ **Configure all the necessary settings** like dependencies, packages, and properties.
    3. 🔐 **Build user authentication APIs** — we'll implement the **Login and Register** functionality.
    
    ### 🔐 1. **Authentication Module**
    
    Handles login and registration.
    
    ### 📌 Endpoints:
    
    | Method | Endpoint | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | POST | `/auth/signup` | Register a new user (e.g. admin, cashier) |
    | POST | `/auth/login` | Login with email & password |
    
    ### 📄 Models:
    
    ```java
    
    private Long id; // Unique ID for each user (primary key)
    
    private String fullName; // Full name of the user
    
    private String password; // Hashed password for login
    
    private String email; // User's email (must be unique and valid)
    
    private String phone; // Optional phone number
    
    private Store store; // Store to which the user belongs (Many users → One store)
    
    private Branch branch; // Branch of the store (used internally)
    
    private UserRole role; // User role: ADMIN, CASHIER, MANAGER etc.
    
    private LocalDateTime createdAt; // Automatically set when user is created
    
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt; // Automatically updated whenever user is modified
    
    private Boolean verified; // True if email or account is verified
    
    private LocalDateTime lastLogin; // Stores the date and time of the last login
    
    ```
    
    ### ✅ Auth Flow:
    
    - On registration, password is hashed using BCrypt.
    - JWT token is generated on successful login.
    - Token is required for accessing secured APIs.

- User Service

    ### 👤 2. **User Module**
    
    Admin can manage users like cashiers and managers.
    
    ### 📄 Model:

        String password;
        String role; // ADMIN, CASHIER
        Boolean isActive;
        LocalDateTime createdAt;
    }
    
    ```
    
    ### 📌 Endpoints:

        String name;
        String barcode;
        Double price;
        Integer quantity;
        String category;
        Boolean isAvailable;

    CopyEdit
    Inventory {
        Long id;
        Long productId;
        Integer quantityAdded;
        Integer currentStock;

    ---
    
    ### 🔁 7. **Service & Mapper Layer**
    
    You’ll have:
    
    - `UserService`, `ProductService`, `SaleService`, etc.
    - `UserServiceImpl` for logic like registration, update user.
    - `UserMapper`, `ProductMapper`: convert between Entity and DTO.
    
    ```java
    java
    CopyEdit
    public interface UserService {
        UserResponse register(UserRequest request);
        UserResponse login(LoginRequest request);
        List<UserResponse> getAllUsers();
        ...
    }
    
    ```
    
    ```java
    java
    CopyEdit
    @Component
    public class UserMapper {
        public UserResponse toResponse(User user) { ... }
        public User toEntity(UserRequest req) { ... }
    }
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### 🔒 8. **Security (JWT)**
    
    - Secures all routes except `/api/auth/**`
    - Role-based access: ADMIN can manage users, CASHIER can create sales.
